# Vendor Security Model Contract

This is model contract language similar to what we use at Dropbox for vendor security requirements.

This is not legal advice.  We highly recommend working with your own legal team to determine how to best employ the model language and modify it to suit your particular needs. Every security program has different challenges and risks, and we hope this is a useful starting recipe.
